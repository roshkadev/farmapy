To test location updates while running or debugging the application in the Android Virtual Device try:
telnet localhost 5554
The port number 5554 can vary. To know at which port your device is listening, look the number at the window title of your device.
  
Copy any of following lines to the telnet console and a location update event will be fired:
geo fix -121.45356 46.51119 4392
geo fix -27.352253 -56.8927 4392
geo fix -56.8927 -27.352253 4392

geo fix -57.654 -25.289405 4000
